# First column is what slot
# Second column is priority number
# Third column is what item
# Fourth column (optional) is conditions for that item to be considered
# Conditionals are formatted as \"<condition type>:<data>\"
# Multiple conditionals can be added separated by a semicolon (;) with NO SPACES
# Conditionals can be prepended with a ! to indicate that they must be FALSE
# Valid conditionals:
## class
### data: The text name of the class, as used by to_class()
### You must be the given class
### As a precaution, sl_ascend aborts if to_class returns $class[none]
## mainstat
### data: The text name of the mainstat, as used by to_stat()
### Your mainstat must be the given stat
### As a precaution, sl_ascend aborts if to_stat returns $stat[none]
## path
### data: The text name of the path, as returned by my_path()
### You must be currently on that path
### No safety checking possible here, so hopefully you don't misspell anything
## skill
### data: Text name of the skill, as used by to_skill()
### You must have the given skill
### As a precaution, sl_ascend aborts if to_skill returns $skill[none]
## effect
### data: Text name of the effect, as used by to_effect()
### You must have at least one turn of the given effect
### As a precaution, sl_ascend aborts if to_effect returns $effect[none]
## prop
### data: <propname>=<value>
### Only simple comparison is available at the moment
## expectghostreport
### data: Doesn't matter, but put something so I don't have to support dataless conditions
### True when you expect a protonic ghost report
### Pretty much just for the protonic accelerator pack
# An item can be listed multiple times (presumably with different conditionals)
# First item found that is available, can be equipped, and meets its conditions (if any) will be used
